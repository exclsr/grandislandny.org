<P>Greetings (again),</P>

<P>Grand Island, NY is a nice place; but, as you may have noticed, its web presence is a bit of a mess.  This is a small attempt to fix that.</P>

<P>The goal is to provide the public (you and me) with some basic information on the town, in a straight-forward manner.  This site will slowly grow over time.  However,
an emphasis will be placed on ease-of-use and social/community prosperity -- that is,
growth will be gradual, even, and healthy; and education- and community-based
initiatives will be given preference.  In the future (7-15 years), this may evolve 
into a community nexus, funded by the public; in the present, there is a <A href="http://buffalo.craigslist.org" title="Buffalo's Craig's List">place for that</A> already.</P>

This humble site was created by a former Grand-Island resident (me, the author), who 
had a few extra hours and a few extra dollars on April 18, 2004.  This site will be updated on a monthly basis.  If you have suggestions, compliments, or helpful information (see above paragraph), please <A href="mailto:phil@grandislandny.org" 
title="Email Phil, the author">email the author</A>.

<!--
<P>The cost for keeping this site up is $154.40/year.  While this cost will surely
go down in the future, the author certainly appreciates donations.  So, if this site
was helpful to you, consider donating $1 to Grand Island NY.org.  Please email 
<A href="mailto:funding@grandislandny.org" title="Help fund this site">funding@grandislandny.org</A> (that is also me, for now) for more information.</P>
-->

<P><EM>More importantly</EM>, if this site was helpful to you, and you 
would like to see it grow, please make it a destination link from your own 
personal (or professional!) website.</P>

<P>Regards,</P>
